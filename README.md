=====================

Used to store my solutions to www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer challenges.

I try to include the LINQPad versions of all examples, but if an example is too complex or has a GUI, a more in-depth Visual Studio Solution may be included.

.linq files can be viewed in any text editor, but are most easily run in LINQPad (http://www.linqpad.net/).
